With reporting delay plus Incubation time:
```
> summary(covid60_epinow_delays)
                            measure               estimate
                             <char>                 <char>
1:           New infections per day     1987 (760 -- 4566)
2: Expected change in daily reports      Likely decreasing
3:       Effective reproduction no.     0.81 (0.43 -- 1.3)
4:                   Rate of growth -0.047 (-0.2 -- 0.092)
5:     Doubling/halving time (days)      -15 (7.5 -- -3.5)
```

#### Interpretation

Interpretation template:

+ From the summary of our analysis we see that the expected change in reports is 
`Likely decreasing` with the estimated new infections, on average, of
`1987` with 90% credible interval of `760` to `4566`.

+ ...

Interpretation Helpers:

- About the effective reproduction number:
    - An Rt greater than 1 implies an increase in cases or an epidemic. 
    - An Rt less than 1 implies a decrease in cases or extinction.
