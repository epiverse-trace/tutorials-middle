# Practical

<!-- visible for learners and instructors at practical -->

This practical has two activities.

Before your start, as a group:

- Create one copy of the Posit Cloud project `<paste link>`.
- Solve each challenge using the `Code chunk` as a guide.
- Paste your figure and table outputs.
- Write your answer to the questions.
- Choose one person from your group to share your results with everyone.


During the practical, instead of copy-paste, we encourage learners to increase their fluency writing R by using:

- Tab key <kbd>↹</kbd> 
for [code completion feature](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/205273297-Code-Completion-in-the-RStudio-IDE) and [possible arguments displayed](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/console.html). 
- The double-colon `package::function()` notation. This helps us remember package functions and avoid namespace conflicts.
- [R shortcuts](https://positron.posit.co/keyboard-shortcuts.html#r-shortcuts):
    - `Cmd/Ctrl`+`Shift`+`M` to Insert the pipe operator (`|>` or `%>%`)
    - `Alt`+`-` to Insert the assignment operator (`<-`)
- The `help()` function or `?` operator to access function reference manual.

## Activity 1: Theme

Estimate ... using the following available inputs:

- input 1
- input 2

As a group, Write your answer to these questions:

- ... phase?
- ... results expected?
- Interpret: How would you communicate these results to a decision-maker?
- Compare: What differences you identify from other group outputs? (if available)

With reporting delay plus Incubation time:
```
> summary(covid60_epinow_delays)
                            measure               estimate
                             <char>                 <char>
1:           New infections per day     1987 (760 -- 4566)
2: Expected change in daily reports      Likely decreasing
3:       Effective reproduction no.     0.81 (0.43 -- 1.3)
4:                   Rate of growth -0.047 (-0.2 -- 0.092)
5:     Doubling/halving time (days)      -15 (7.5 -- -3.5)
```

#### Interpretation

Interpretation template:

+ From the summary of our analysis we see that the expected change in reports is 
`Likely decreasing` with the estimated new infections, on average, of
`1987` with 90% credible interval of `760` to `4566`.

+ ...

Interpretation Helpers:

- About the effective reproduction number:
    - An Rt greater than 1 implies an increase in cases or an epidemic. 
    - An Rt less than 1 implies a decrease in cases or extinction.
