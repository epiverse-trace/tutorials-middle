## Epiverse-TRACE tutorials

The Epiverse-TRACE tutorials are training materials for Outbreak Analysis tasks aimed at [learners](../profiles.md) who are willing to achieve basic competence in modelling and analytics.

The tutorials are built around the workflow of outbreak analysis split into three stages : early tasks, middle tasks and late tasks.

![An overview of the tutorial topics](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/task_pipeline-minimal.svg)

Task topics consist of one or more episodes. You can navigate to different episodes using the menu on the left hand side. Alternatively, you may find the topic you are interested in the [key points](../key-points.md) of each episode.

Each episode contains:

+ **Overview** : describes what questions will be answered and what are the objectives of the episode.
+ **Prerequisites**: describes what episodes/packages need to be covered before the current episode.
+ **Example R code** : work through the episodes on your own computer using the example R code.
+ **Challenges** : complete challenges to test your understanding.
+ **Explainers** : add to your understanding of mathematical and modelling concepts with the explainer boxes.

Also check out the [glossary](../reference.md) for any terms you may be unfamiliar with.
