## Introduction

<!-- we know -->

From epidemics like Smallpox or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we know that some people spread disease more than others. Since disease transmission is caused by many physiological and social factors, we usually use population averages to assess the disease potential to spread. However, individual differences in infectiousness increase the tendency towards superspreading events (SSEs) which can ignite explosive epidemics and affect the ease of control.

![**Chains of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Hong Kong initiated by local or imported cases.** (**a**), Transmission network of a cluster of cases traced back to a collection of four bars across Hong Kong (n = 106). (**b**), Transmission network associated with a wedding without clear infector–infectee pairs but linked back to a preceding social gathering and local source (n = 22). (**c**), Transmission network associated with a temple cluster of undetermined source (n = 19). (**d**), All other clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infections where the source and transmission chain could be determined ([Adam et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1092-0)).](fig/see-intro-superspreading.png)

<!-- we dont know -->

The [basic reproduction number](../learners/reference.md#basic), $R_0$, is the average number of cases caused by one infectious individual in a entirely susceptible population. Population estimates of $R_0$ can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 by numerous ‘superspreading events’ in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases ([Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04153)).

![**Observed offspring distribution of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Hong Kong.** N = 91 SARS-CoV-2 infectors, N = 153 terminal infectees and N = 46 sporadic local cases. Histogram bars indicate the proportion of onward transmission per amount of secondary cases. Line corresponds to a fitted negative binomial distribution ([Adam et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1092-0)).](fig/see-intro-secondary-cases-fig-b.png){alt='R = 0.58 and k = 0.43.'}

<!-- we want -->

In this tutorial, we are going to estimate the individual variation in transmission and assess its heterogeneity, which often results in superspreading events. Also, we are going to use these estimates to account for superspreading in contact tracing interventions.

We are going to use data from the `{outbreaks}` package, manage linelist and contacts data using `{epicontacts}`, and estimate distribution parameters with `{fitdistrplus}`. Lastly, we are going to use `{superspreading}` to account for it in decision-making.

We’ll use the pipe `%>%` to connect some of their functions, so let’s also call to the `{tidyverse}` package:

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(outbreaks)
library(epicontacts)
library(fitdistrplus)
library(superspreading)
library(tidyverse)
```

## The individual reprodution number

Reconstruction of transmission trees (whom infected whom) can provide an understanding of who contributes more to transmission. This can be done with detailed case investigations and/or genetic data ([Cori et al., 2017](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2016.0371))

Let's use the `mers_korea_2015` linelist and contact data from `{outbreaks}` with `{epicontacts}` to get the distribution of secondary cases ([Campbell, 2022](https://community.appliedepi.org/t/estimating-the-degree-of-super-spreading-from-transmission-chain-data/103/2)):

```{r}
## make epicontact object
epi_contacts <- 
  epicontacts::make_epicontacts(
    linelist = mers_korea_2015$linelist,
    contacts = mers_korea_2015$contacts
  )
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# visualise contact tree
epicontacts::vis_epicontacts(epi_contacts)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# visualise contact tree
network <-
  epicontacts::vis_epicontacts(epi_contacts) %>%
  visNetwork::visPhysics(solver = "barnesHut")

fname <- "network.html"

visNetwork::visSave(network, fname)

webshot::webshot(
  fname,
  delay = 5,
  zoom = 10
)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

### Is contact data tidy?

Contact data contains information of whom infected whom. We expect to have the infector (`from`) and the infectee (`to`) plus additional columns of variables related to their contact like location (`exposure`) and date of contact.

Following [tidy data](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html#tidy-data) principles, in contact data the observation unit is the **infector-infectee** pair. Although one infector can infect multiple infectees, from contact tracing investigations we may record infectees contacts with more than one infector. But we should expect to have unique infector-infectee pairs.

We can check on replicates for infectees:

```{r}
# no infector-infectee pairs are replicated
epi_contacts %>%
  pluck("contacts") %>%
  group_by(to) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When each infector-infectee row is unique, the number of entries per infector corresponds to the number of secondary cases.

```{r}
# count secondary cases per infector
infector_secondary <- epi_contacts %>%
  pluck("contacts") %>%
  count(from, name = "secondary_cases")
```

The number 

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
epi_secondary <-
  epi_contacts %>%
  # extract ids in contact *and* linelist
  # using "which" argument
  epicontacts::get_id(which = "all") %>%
  enframe(name = NULL, value = "from") %>%
  # join count secondary cases per infectee
  left_join(infector_secondary) %>%
  # infectee with missing secondary cases
  # are replaced with zero
  replace_na(
    replace = list(secondary_cases = 0)
  )

# arrange in descendant order of secondary cases
epi_secondary %>%
  arrange(desc(secondary_cases))

## plot the distribution
epi_secondary %>%
  ggplot(aes(secondary_cases)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Number of secondary cases",
    y = "Frequency"
  )
```

The _individual reproductive number_, ν, is defined as a random variable representing the expected number of secondary cases caused by a particular infected individual. 

Values for ν are drawn from a continuous probability distribution with population mean $R_{o}$ that encodes all variation in infectious histories of individuals, including properties of the host and pathogen and environmental circumstances. 

In this framework, superspreading events (SSEs) are not exceptional events, but important realizations from the right-hand tail of a distribution of ν ([Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04153)).

  )
```


## Estimate the offspring distribution

Stochastic effects in transmission are modelled using a Poisson process4, so that the number of secondary infections caused by each case, Z, is described by an ‘offspring distribution’ Pr(Z = k) where Z∼Poisson(ν).

By considering three possible distributions of ν, we generate three candidate models for the offspring distribution: (1) in generation-based models neglecting individual variation, ν = R0 for all cases, yielding Z∼Poisson(R0); (2) in differential-equation models with homogeneous transmission and constant recovery rates, ν is exponentially distributed, yielding Z∼geometric(R0); (3) in a more general formulation, we let ν be gamma-distributed with mean R0 and dispersion parameter k, yielding Z∼negative binomial(R0,k) (ref. 23). The negative binomial model includes the conventional Poisson (k → ∞) and geometric (k = 1) models as special cases. It has variance R0(1 + R0/k), so smaller values of k indicate greater heterogeneity.

the offspring distribution, 

- can be characterized by a statistical distribution
    - negative binomial, usually
- with distribution parameters given by 
    - R0 as the mean and 
        + average number of (secondary) cases produced by a single individual in an entirely susceptible population
    - k as the dispersion parameter, 
        +degree of heterogeneity in transmission by single individuals


fit distribution to data using {fitdistrplus}
provide maximum likelihood estimates

the estimated value of k
suggest that
SSE are an expected feature of the
individual level variation in infectiousness



```{r}
library(fitdistrplus)

## fit distribution
offspring_fit <- epi_secondary %>%
  pull(secondary_cases) %>%
  fitdist(distr = "nbinom")

offspring_fit

## extract the "size" parameter
mid <- offspring_fit$estimate[["size"]]
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
## calculate the 95% confidence intervals using the standard error estimate and
## the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of the normal distribution.
lower <- mid + offspring_fit$sd[["size"]] * qnorm(0.025)
upper <- mid + offspring_fit$sd[["size"]] * qnorm(0.975)
```

We can see that the
dispersion parameter is estimated as
`r round(mid, 3)` (95% CI `r `round(lower, 3)` - `r round(upper, 3)`).

As this value is significantly lower
than one, we can conclude that
the degree of super-spreading is high.

This is in line with visual inspection
of the histogram made above.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# calculate density fit
fit_density <-
  tibble(quantile = 0:40) %>%
  mutate(
    density = dnbinom(
      x = quantile,
      mu = offspring_fit$estimate[["mu"]],
      size = mid
    )
  )

# plot offspring distribution with density fit
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(
    data = epi_secondary,
    mapping =
      aes(
        x = secondary_cases,
        y = after_stat(density)
      ),
    binwidth = 1
  ) +
  geom_point(
    data = fit_density,
    mapping = aes(x = quantile, y = density),
    alpha = 0.3, color = "red"
  ) +
  labs(
    xlab = "Individual reproduction number",
    ylab = "Number of individuals"
  )

## Interpret the dispersion parameter

<!-- from draft -->

- for occurrences of associated discrete events we can use Poisson or negative binomial discrete distributions.
- in a Poisson distribution, mean is equal to variance.
- when variance is higher than the mean, this is called over-dispersion.
- in biological applications, over-dispersion occurs and so a negative binomial may be worth considering as an alternative to Poisson distribution.

- in epidemiology, negative binomial have being used to model disease transmission for infectious diseases where the likely number of onward infections may vary considerably from individual to individual and from setting to setting

- In a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, in each trial the probability of success is $p$ and of failure is $1-p$. We observe this sequence until a predefined number $r$ of successes occurs. Then the random number of observed failures follows the negative binomial distribution.
- some authors refer to $\alpha = \frac{1}{r}$ and express variance in terms of $\alpha$: $variance = m + \alpha m^2$ where mean $ m = \frac{r(1-p)}{p}$
- depending on the author, either the parameter  or its the reciprocal of $r$, $\alpha$, is refereed to as the "dispersion parameter".

- From Lloyd-Smith, in a more general formulation, we let $v$ be gamma-distributed with mean $R_{o}$ and dispersion parameter $k$, yielding $Z$~negative binomial($R_{o}, k$). The negative binomial model includes the conventional Poisson ($k \rightarrow \inf$) as an special case. It has variance $R_{o}(1 + R_{o}/k)$, so smaller values of $k$ indicate (greater variance, thus) greater heterogeneity.

- To sync up with Lloyd-Smith and R base function for negative binomial, $k = r = {size} = {inverse-dispersion}$

- negative binomial distribution is specially useful for discrete data over an unbounded positive range whose sample variance exceeds the sample mean. In such terms, the observations are overdispersed with respect to a Poisson distribution, for which the mean is equal to the variance.
- The additional parameter of the negative binomial distribution ($r$) can be used to adjust the variance independently of the mean.

<!-- paste from 37-nbinom-dispersion.R -->

the "dispersion" parameter
refers to the "size" for base R
or
refer to the "k" parameter for Lloyd-Smith
of the negative binomial distribution

k is inversely-proportional
to variance (i.e, to heterogeneity)
- high k -> get low variance (low heterogeneity)
- low k -> get high variance (high heterogeneity)

when k approches infinity,
the negative binomial approaches poisson

negative binomial
two parameters:
- mean (or R0, in offspring distribution)
- size (or k, named also dispersion)

variance =
mean(1 + mean/k)

higher k,
(higher inverse-dispersion),
lower variance,
(variance closer to mean)
lower heterogeneity

lower k
(lower the inverse-dispersion),
higher the variance,
(variance further from mean)
higher  heterogeneity

useful when variance is higher than mean
for discrete data
when observations exceed a positive range
whose sample variance exceeds the
sample mean.
thus, the observations are overdispersed
with respect to a Poisson distribution

a Poisson distribution can be defined as
an special case of Negative Binomial
when k approaches infinity
or
variance gets closer to mean
or
when mean/variance ratio gets closer to 1

<!-- summary -->

In a Negative Binomial distribution, the relationship between mean (Ro), dispersion (k), variance and heterogeneity is given by:

$$ \uparrow heterogeneity = \uparrow variance = R_{o}(1+\frac{R_{o}}{\downarrow k})$$

The Poisson distribution is an special case of the Negative Binomial. When k approximates infinity $k \rightarrow \infty$ the variance equals the mean because $\frac{R_{o}}{\infty}=0$

## Evidence for variation in individual reproductive number

Comparing our findings to the 20/80 rule proposed for sexually transmitted and vector-borne diseases, no general rule emerges but the core principle of heterogeneous transmission is certainly supported (Fig. 1c).

- focus on the cumulative probability distribution of the most infectious cases
    + if there is a 0.2 proportion of (the most infectious) cases contributing to the 0.8 proportion of transmission, this is a highly heterogeneous distribution. (e.g. SARS)
    + if there is a 0.6 proportion of (the most infectious) cases contributing to the 0.8 of transmission, this is a less heterogeneous distribution (compared to the above one, e.g. pneumonic plague)

![Proportion of transmission expected from the most infectious 20% of cases, for 10 outbreak or surveillance data sets (triangles). Dashed lines show proportions expected under the 20/80 rule (top) and homogeneity (bottom). Superscript ‘v’ indicates a partially vaccinated population.](fig/SEE-individual-reproductive-number-fig-c.png)

The comparison of directly transmitted infections reveals the differing degree of individual variation among diseases and outbreak settings. Like SARS, measles in highly vaccinated populations shows high variation, with heterogeneous vaccination coverage as an important environmental factor contributing to this pattern. Monkeypox and smallpox viruses show intermediate variation, consistent across multiple data sets, and pneumonic plague transmission is slightly less variable.

![Expected proportion of all transmission due to a given proportion of infectious cases, where cases are ranked by infectiousness. For a homogeneous population (all ν = R0), this relation is linear. For five directly transmitted infections (based on specific k values), the line is concave owing to variation in ν.](fig/SEE-individual-reproductive-number-fig-b.png)

### Define Superspreading events

Lloyds propose a general protocol for defining a superspreading event:

- define an SSE as any infected individual who infects more than Z(n) others, where Z(n) is the nth percentile of the Poisson(R) distribution. 
- A 99th-percentile SSE is then any case causing more infections than would occur in 99% of infectious histories in a homogeneous population

```{r}
qpois(
  p = 0.99,
  lambda = offspring_fit$estimate["mu"]
)
```

Stars represent SSEs caused by more than one source case. ‘Other’ diseases are: 1, Streptococcus group A; 2, Lassa fever; 3, Mycoplasma pneumonia; 4, pneumonic plague; 5, tuberculosis. R is not shown for ‘other’ diseases, and is off-scale for monkeypox.](fig/SEE-individual-reproductive-number-fig-d.png)

## Backward and forward contact tracing

Contact tracing can be deployed in multiple strategies. Forward tracing targets downstream individuals who may be infected by index individual. Backward tracing targets the upstream primary case who infected the index case (or a setting or event at which the index case was infected) by retracing history of contact to the likely point of exposure up to the upper bound of the incubation period.

In the presence of heterogeneous transmission, i.e., with an overdispersed offspring distribution, if this primary case is identified, a larger fraction of the transmission chain can be detected by forward tracing each of the contacts of this primary case  ([Endo et al., 2020](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-239/v3)).

![Schematic representation of contact tracing strategies. Black arrows indicate the directions of transmission, blue and Orange arrows, a successful or failed contact tracing, respectivelly. When there is evidence of individual-level transmission heterogeneity, often resulting in superspreading, backward contact tracing from the index case (blue circle) increase the probability to find the primary case (green circle) or clusters with a larger fraction of cases, potentially increasing the number of quarentined cases (yellow circles). [Claire Blackmore, 2021](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/backward_contact_tracing_v3_0.pdf)](fig/contact-tracing-strategies.png)

When there is evidence of individual-level variation (i.e. overdispersion), often resulting in so-called superspreading events, a large proportion of infections may be linked to a small proportion of original clusters. As a result, finding and targeting originating clusters in combination with reducing onwards infection may substantially enhance the effectiveness of tracing methods [Endo et al., 2020](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-239/v3).


## Proportion of events in a given cluster size

By looking at the tail of the probability offspring distribution, we can identify the size of the cluster of secondary infections. The probability that a cluster of secondary infections caused by a primary case identified by backward tracing has a size of $X$ or larger ([Endo et al., 2020](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-239/v3)).

```{r}
# estimate the probability of
# having a cluster size of 5, 10, or 25
# secondary cases from a primary case,
# given known reproduction number and
# dispersion parameter.
proportion_cluster_size(
  R = offspring_fit$estimate["mu"],
  k = offspring_fit$estimate["size"],
  cluster_size = c(5, 10, 25)
)

```

Even though we have an $R<1$, given a highly overdispersed offspring distribution ($k=0.02$) we have a 46.9% probability to find a cluster of 25 people or larger.

The probability of a cluster size can also inform backwards contact tracing efforts. Among other factors, high cluster sizes could imply that a contac tracing approach may no longer likely result in successful containment due to increased proportion of contacts not identified by the process or achieving low case ascertainment ([Public Health England, 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-when-to-stop-contact-tracing-developing-triggers-from-phe-systems-20-february-2020)).

We can also use this number to prevent gathering of certain sized to reduce the epidemic by preventing potential superspreading events. Interventions can target to reduce the reproduction number in order to reduce the probability of having clusters of secondary cases.

## Superspreading in decision making

Transmission heterogeneity affects epidemic establishment and the ease of control ([Cori et al., 2017](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2016.0371)). 

+ Greater heterogeneity reduces the chance of an outbreak emerging from single case. Individuals with more extreme amount of secondary cases are rare.

+ However, if the outbreak gets established, this heterogeneity can make an outbreak hard to control using *mass interventions* (which assumes transmission homogeneity), as a single uncontrolled case can generate a large number of secondary cases.

+ Conversely, heterogeneity in transmission may provide opportunities for *targeted interventions* if the individuals who contribute more to transmission (due to biological, environmental or behavioral factors) share socio-demographic or geographical characteristics that can be defined.

We can have an early understanding of a disease epidemic potential from the mean reproduction number $R_{o}$ and dispersion $k$ of an offspring distribution to answer questions like:

- What is the probability of an pathogen to cause large outbreak?
- What is the probability of an outbreak to get extinct?
- What is the probability to contain the ongoing outbreak?
