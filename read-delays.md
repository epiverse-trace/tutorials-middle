## Prerequisites

This episode requires you to be familiar with:

**Data science** : Basic programming with R.

**Epidemic theory** : Epidemiological parameters. Time periods.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

The [natural history](../learners/reference.md#naturalhistory) of an infectious disease shows that its development has a regularity from stage to stage. The time periods from an infectious disease inform about the timing of transmission and interventions.

![Definition of key time periods. From [Xiang et al, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042721000038)](fig/time-periods.jpg)

### Definitions

Look at the [glossary](../learners/reference.md) for the definitions of all the time periods of the figure above!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

However, early in an epidemic, modelling efforts can be delayed by the lack of a centralized resource that summarises input parameters for the disease of interest ([Nash et al., 2023](https://mrc-ide.github.io/epireview/)). Projects like `{epiparameter}` and `{epireview}` are building online catalogues following systematic review protocols that can help build models faster for coming outbreaks and epidemics from known pathogens and unknown ones related to known families of viruses.

<!-- Early models for COVID-19 used parameters from other coronaviruses. https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1473-3099(20)30144-4/fulltext -->

To exemplify how to use `{epiparameter}` in your analysis pipeline, our goal in this episode will be to replace the `generation_time` input that we can use for `EpiNow2::epinow()`.

```r
epinow_estimates <- epinow(
  # cases
  reported_cases = example_confirmed[1:60],
  # delays
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  # computation
  stan = stan_opts(
    cores = 4, samples = 1000, chains = 3,
    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)
  )
)
```

To do this replacement, instead of plug-in numeric values to `EpiNow2::dist_spec()` to manually specify the delay distribution parameters, we are going to collect them from the library of epidemiological parameters provided by `{epiparameter}`:

```r
generation_time <- dist_spec(
  mean = 3.6,
  sd = 3.1,
  max = 20,
  distribution = "lognormal"
)
```

Let's explore how we can access this and other time delays using `{epiparameter}`. We'll use the pipe `%>%` to connect some of their functions, so let's also call to the `{tidyverse}` package:


```r
library(epiparameter)
library(EpiNow2)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Find a Generation time

The generation time, jointly with the $R$, can inform about the speed of spread and its feasibility of control. Given a $R>1$, with a shorter generation time, cases can appear more quickly.

![Video from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Ep 76. Science In Context - Epi Parameter Review Group with Dr Anne Cori (27-07-2023) at <https://youtu.be/VvpYHhFDIjI?si=XiUyjmSV1gKNdrrL>](fig/reproduction-generation-time.png)

In calculating the effective reproduction number ($R_{t}$), the *generation time* distribution is often approximated by the [serial interval](../learners/reference.md#serialinterval) distribution.
This frequent approximation is because it is easier to observe and measure the onset of symptoms than the onset of infectiousness.

![A schematic of the relationship of different time periods of transmission between an infector and an infectee in a transmission pair. Exposure window is defined as the time interval having viral exposure, and transmission window is defined as the time interval for onward transmission with respect to the infection time ([Chung Lau et al. 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/224/10/1664/6356465)).](fig/serial-interval-observed.jpeg)

However, using the *serial interval* as an approximation of the *generation time* is primarily valid for diseases in which infectiousness starts after symptom onset ([Chung Lau et al. 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/224/10/1664/6356465)). In cases where infectiousness starts before symptom onset, the serial intervals can have negative values, which is the case of a pre-symptomatic transmission ([Nishiura et al. (2020)](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30119-3/fulltext#gr2)).

Additionally, even if the *generation time* and *serial interval* have the same mean, their variance usually differs, propagating bias to the $R_{t}$ estimation. $R_{t}$ estimates are sensitive not only to the mean generation time but also to the variance and form of the generation interval distribution [(Gostic et al., 2020)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409).

::::::::::::::::: callout

### From time periods to probability distributions.

When we calculate the *serial interval*, we see that not all case pairs have the same time length. We will observe this variability for any case pair and individual time period, including the [incubation period](../learners/reference.md#incubation) and [infectious period](../learners/reference.md#infectiousness).

![Serial intervals of possible case pairs in (a) COVID-19 and (b) MERS-CoV. Pairs represent a presumed infector and their presumed infectee plotted by date of symptom onset ([Althobaity et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042722000537#fig6)).](fig/serial-interval-pairs.jpg)

To summarize these data from individual and pair time periods, we can find the **statistical distributions** that best fit the data ([McFarland et al., 2023](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.27.2200806)).

<!-- add a reference about good practices to estimate distributions -->

![Fitted serial interval distribution for (a) COVID-19 and (b) MERS-CoV based on reported transmission pairs in Saudi Arabia. We fitted three commonly used distributions, Lognormal, Gamma, and Weibull distributions, respectively ([Althobaity et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042722000537#fig5)).](fig/seria-interval-fitted-distributions.jpg)

Statistical distributions are summarized in terms of their **summary statistics** like the *location* (mean and percentiles) and *spread* (variance or standard deviation) of the distribution, or with their **distribution parameters** that inform about the *form* (shape and rate/scale) of the distribution. These estimated values can be reported with their **uncertainty** (95% confidence intervals).

| Gamma | mean | shape | rate/scale |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| MERS-CoV | 14.13(13.9–14.7) | 6.31(4.88–8.52) | 0.43(0.33–0.60) |
| COVID-19 | 5.1(5.0–5.5) | 2.77(2.09–3.88) | 0.53(0.38–0.76) |

| Weibull | mean | shape | rate/scale |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| MERS-CoV | 14.2(13.3–15.2) | 3.07(2.64–3.63) | 16.1(15.0–17.1) |
| COVID-19 | 5.2(4.6–5.9) | 1.74(1.46–2.11) | 5.83(5.08–6.67) |

| Log normal | mean | mean-log | sd-log |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| MERS-CoV | 14.08(13.1–15.2) | 2.58(2.50–2.68) | 0.44(0.39–0.5) |
| COVID-19 | 5.2(4.2–6.5) | 1.45(1.31–1.61) | 0.63(0.54–0.74) |

### Serial interval

Assume that COVID-19 and SARS have similar reproduction number values and that the serial interval approximates the generation time. 

Given the Serial interval of both infections in the figure below: 

- Which one would be harder to control? 
- Why do you conclude that?

![Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections overlaid with a published distribution of SARS. ([Nishiura et al, 2020](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30119-3/fulltext))](fig/serial-interval-covid-sars.jpg)

::::::::::::::::: hint

The peak of each curve can inform you about the location of the mean of each distribution. The larger the mean, the larger the serial interval.

::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::: solution

Which one would be harder to control?

- COVID-19

Why do you conclude that?

- COVID-19 has the lowest mean serial interval. The approximate mean value for the serial interval of COVID-19 is around four days, and SARS is about seven days. Thus, COVID-19 will likely have newer generations in less time than SARS, assuming similar reproduction numbers.

The objective of the assessment above is to assess the interpretation of a larger or shorter generation time.

::::::::::::::::::::::

## Extract epidemiological parameters

First, let's assume that the data set `example_confirmed` has COVID-19 observed cases. So, we need to find a reported generation time for COVID-19 or any other useful parameter for this aim. 

Let's start by looking at how many parameters we have in the epidemiological distributions database (`epidist_db`) for the `disease` named `covid`-19:


```r
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "covid"
)
```

```{.output}
Returning 27 results that match the criteria (22 are parameterised). 
Use subset to filter by entry variables or single_epidist to return a single entry. 
To retrieve the short citation for each use the 'get_citation' function
```

```{.output}
List of <epidist> objects
  Number of entries in library: 27
  Number of studies in library: 10
  Number of diseases: 1
  Number of delay distributions: 27
  Number of offspring distributions: 0
```

From the `{epiparameter}` package, we can use the `epidist_db()` function to ask for any `disease` and also for a specific epidemiological distribution (`epi_dist`). 

Let's ask now how many parameters we have in the epidemiological distributions database (`epidist_db`) with the generation time using the string `generation`:


```r
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  epi_dist = "generation"
)
```

```{.output}
Returning 1 results that match the criteria (1 are parameterised). 
Use subset to filter by entry variables or single_epidist to return a single entry. 
To retrieve the short citation for each use the 'get_citation' function
```

```{.output}

Currently, in the library of epidemiological parameters, we have one `generation` time entry for Influenza. Considering the abovementioned considerations, we can look at the `serial` intervals for `COVID`-19.


```r

  disease = "COVID",
  epi_dist = "serial"
)

### CASE-INSENSITIVE

`epidist_db` is [case-insensitive](https://dillionmegida.com/p/case-sensitivity-vs-case-insensitivity/#case-insensitivity). This means that you can use strings with letters in upper or lower case indistinctly.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

We get more than one epidemiological delay. To summarize this view and get the column names from the underlying parameter dataset, we can add the `epiparameter::list_distributions()` function to the previous code using the pipe `%>%`:


```r
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "covid",
  epi_dist = "serial"
) %>%
  epiparameter::list_distributions()
```

### Ebola's incubation periods

Take 5 minutes:

- How many delay distributions are for the Ebola disease?

- How many delay distributions are for the incubation period of Ebola?

- Explore the library and find the disease with the delay distribution of your interest! Do you recognize the paper?

::::::::::::::::: hint

The `{epiparameter}` combo of `epidist_db()` plus `list_distributions()` list all the entries by:

- disease,
- epidemiological distribution,
- the type of the probability distribution,
- author of the study, and 
- year of study.

::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::: solution


```r
# 16 delays distributions
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "ebola"
)

# 5 delay distributions are for the incubation period
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "ebola",
  epi_dist = "incubation"
)
```

Now, from the output of `epiparameter::epidist_db()`, What is an [offspring distribution](../learners/reference.md#offspringdist)?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Select a single distribution

The `epiparameter::epidist_db()` function works as a filtering or subset function. Let's use the `author` argument to filter `Hiroshi Nishiura` parameters:


```r
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "covid",
  epi_dist = "serial",
  author = "Hiroshi"
) %>%
  epiparameter::list_distributions()
```

```{.output}
Returning 2 results that match the criteria (2 are parameterised). 
Use subset to filter by entry variables or single_epidist to return a single entry. 
To retrieve the short citation for each use the 'get_citation' function
```

```{.output}
   disease epi_distribution prob_distribution       author year
1 COVID-19  serial interval             lnorm Hiroshi .... 2020
2 COVID-19  serial interval           weibull Hiroshi .... 2020
```

We still get more than one epidemiological parameter. We can set the `single_epidist` argument to `TRUE` to only one:


```r
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "covid",
  epi_dist = "serial",
  author = "Hiroshi",
  single_epidist = TRUE
)
```

### How does `single_epidist` works?

Looking at the help documentation for `?epiparameter::epidist_db()`:

- If multiple entries match the arguments supplied and `single_epidist = TRUE`,
- Then, the parameterised `⁠<epidist>`⁠ with the largest sample size will be returned.
- If multiple entries are equal after this sorting, the first entry will be returned.

What does a parametrised `<epidist>` is? Look at `?is_parameterised`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now, we have an epidemiological parameter we can reuse! We can replace the numbers we plug into `EpiNow2::dist_spec()`.

Let's assign this `<epidist>` class object to the `covid_serialint` object.


```r
covid_serialint <-
  epiparameter::epidist_db(
    disease = "covid",
    epi_dist = "serial",

## Continuous distributions

The following output has four entries with different content in the **probability distribution** (`prob_distribution`) column:

  )
```

```{.output}
Returning 4 results that match the criteria (3 are parameterised). 
Use subset to filter by entry variables or single_epidist to return a single entry. 
To retrieve the short citation for each use the 'get_citation' function

4 COVID-19  serial interval              norm Lin Yang.... 2020
```

Entries with a missing value (`<NA>`) in the `prob_distribution` column are *non-parameterised* entries. They have summary statistics but no probability distribution. Compare these two outputs:


```r
distribution[[1]]$summary_stats
distribution[[1]]$prob_dist
```

::::::::::::::::: spoiler

### Parameterised entries have an Inference method

As detailed in `?is_parameterised`, a parameterised distribution is the entry that has a probability distribution associated with it provided by an `inference_method` as shown in `metadata`:


```r
distribution[[1]]$metadata$inference_method
distribution[[2]]$metadata$inference_method
distribution[[4]]$metadata$inference_method
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

In the `epiparameter::list_distributions()` output, we can also find different types of probability distributions (e.g., Log-normal, Weibull, Normal).


```r
distribution %>%
  list_distributions()
```

```{.output}
   disease epi_distribution prob_distribution       author year
1 COVID-19  serial interval              <NA> Muluneh .... 2021
2 COVID-19  serial interval             lnorm Hiroshi .... 2020
3 COVID-19  serial interval           weibull Hiroshi .... 2020
4 COVID-19  serial interval              norm Lin Yang.... 2020
```

In `{epiparameter}`, you will mostly find **continuous** distributions like these. You can visualize any of them with the `plot()` function and access to: 

- the *Probability Density Function (PDF)* and 
- the *Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)*.


```r

Conceptually, it provides a way to select a numeric value within a specified range by visually sliding or dragging a pointer (the handle) along a continuous axis. -->

## Distribution functions

In R, all the statistical distributions have functions to access the:

- Probability **Density** function (PDF),
- Cumulative Distribution function (**CDF**),
- **Quantile** function, and
- **Random** values from the given distribution.

### Functions for the Normal distribution

If you need it, read in detail about the [R probability functions for the normal distribution](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/3d1eb92e-7848-4f55-90c3-7c72a54e7e43/public/docs/lectures/lecture13.htm#probfunc), each of its definitions and identify in which part of a distribution they are located!

### Window for contact tracing and the Serial interval

The **serial interval** is important in the optimization of contact tracing since it provides a time window for the containment of a disease spread ([Fine, 2003](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/158/11/1039/162725)). Depending on the serial interval, we can evaluate the need to expand the number of days pre-onset to consider in the contact tracing to include more backwards contacts ([Davis et al., 2020](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/61e9ab3f8fa8f50597fb3078/S0523_Oxford_-_Backwards_contact_tracing.pdf)).

With the COVID-19 serial interval (`covid_serialint`) calculate:

- How much more of the backward cases could be captured if the contact tracing method considered contacts up to 6 days pre-onset compared to 2 days pre-onset?

::::::::::::::::: hint

In Figure 5 from the [R probability functions for the normal distribution](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/3d1eb92e-7848-4f55-90c3-7c72a54e7e43/public/docs/lectures/lecture13.htm#probfunc), the shadowed section represents a cumulative probability of `0.997` for the quantile value at `x = 2`.

::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::: solution


```r
plot(covid_serialint)
```


```r
cdf(covid_serialint, q = 2)
cdf(covid_serialint, q = 6)
```

Given the COVID-19 serial interval:

- A contact tracing method considering contacts up to 2 days pre-onset will capture around 11.1% of backward cases.

- If this period is extended to 6 days pre-onset, this could include 76.2% of backward contacts.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::: solution

### What if

If we exchange the question between days and cumulative probability to: 

- When considering secondary cases, how many days following the symptom onset of primary cases can we expect 55% of symptom onset to occur?


```r
quantile(covid_serialint, p = 0.55)
```

An interpretation could be:

- The 55% percent of the symptom onset of secondary cases will happen after 4.2 days after the symptom onset of primary cases.

## Discretize a continuous distribution

We are getting closer to the end! `EpiNow2::dist_spec()` still needs a maximum value (`max`). 

One way to do this is to get the quantile value for the distribution's 99.9th percentile or `0.999` cumulative probability. For this, we need access to the set of distribution functions for our `<epidist>` object.

We can use the set of distribution functions for a _continuous_ distribution (as above). However, these values will be _continuous_ numbers. We can **discretize** the continuous distribution stored in our `<epidist>` object to get discrete values from a continuous distribution.

When we `epiparameter::discretise()` the continuous distribution we get a **discrete**(-ized) distribution:


```r
covid_serialint_discrete <-
  epiparameter::discretise(covid_serialint)

covid_serialint_discrete
```

```{.output}
Disease: COVID-19
Pathogen: SARS-CoV-2
Epi Distribution: serial interval
Study: Nishiura H, Linton N, Akhmetzhanov A (2020). "Serial interval of novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) infections." _International Journal of
Infectious Diseases_. doi:10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.060
<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.060>.
Distribution: discrete lnorm
Parameters:
  meanlog: 1.386
  sdlog: 0.568
```

We identify this change in the `Distribution:` output line of the `<epidist>` object. Take a double check to this line:

```
Distribution: discrete lnorm
```

While for a **continuous** distribution, we plot the *Probability Density Function (PDF)*, for a **discrete** distribution, we plot the *Probability Mass Function (PMF)*:


```r
# continuous
plot(covid_serialint)

# discrete
plot(covid_serialint_discrete)
```

To finally get a `max` value, let's access the quantile value of the 99.9th percentile or `0.999` probability of the distribution with the `prob_dist$q` notation, similarly to how we access the `summary_stats` values.


```r
covid_serialint_discrete_max <-
  covid_serialint_discrete$prob_dist$q(p = 0.999)
```

### Lenght of quarantine and Incubation period

The **incubation period** distribution is a useful delay to assess the length of active monitoring or quarantine ([Lauer et al., 2020](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-0504)). Similarly, delays from symptom onset to recovery (or death) will determine the required duration of health-care and case isolation ([Cori et al., 2017](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2016.0371)).

Calculate:

- Within what exact time frame do 99% of individuals who develop COVID-19 symptoms exhibit them after infection?

::::::::::::::::: hint

What delay distribution measures the time between infection and the onset of symptoms?

The probability function for `<epidist>` **discrete** distributions differ from the *continuous* ones!


```r
# plot to have a visual reference
plot(covid_serialint_discrete, day_range = 0:20)

# density value at quantile value 10 (day)
covid_serialint_discrete$prob_dist$d(10)

# cumulative probability at quantile value 10 (day)
covid_serialint_discrete$prob_dist$cdf(10)

# In what quantile value (days) do we have the 60% cumulative probability?
covid_serialint_discrete$prob_dist$q(0.6)

# generate random values
covid_serialint_discrete$prob_dist$r(10)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::: solution


```r
covid_incubation <-
  epiparameter::epidist_db(
    disease = "covid",
    epi_dist = "incubation",
    single_epidist = TRUE
  )

covid_incubation_discrete <- epiparameter::discretise(covid_incubation)

covid_incubation_discrete$prob_dist$q(0.99)
```

99% of those who develop COVID-19 symptoms will do so within 16 days of infection.

Now, _Is this result expected in epidemiological terms?_

::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### how to create a distribution plot?

From a maximum value with `$prob_dist$q()`, we can create a sequence of quantile values as a numeric vector and map density values for each:


```r
# create a discrete distribution visualization
# from a maximum value from the distribution
covid_serialint_discrete$prob_dist$q(0.999) %>%
  # generate quantile values
  # as a sequence for each natural number
  seq(1L, to = ., by = 1L) %>%
  # coerce numeric vector to data frame
  as_tibble_col(column_name = "quantile_values") %>%
  mutate(
    # map density values
    # for each quantile in the density function
    density_values =
      covid_serialint_discrete$prob_dist$d(quantile_values)
  ) %>%
  # create plot
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = quantile_values,
      y = density_values
    )
  ) +
  geom_col()
```

## Plug-in `{epiparameter}` to `{EpiNow2}`

Now we can plug everything into the `EpiNow2::dist_spec()` function!


```r
serial_interval_covid <-
  dist_spec(
    mean = covid_serialint$summary_stats$mean,
    sd = covid_serialint$summary_stats$sd,
    max = covid_serialint_discrete_max,

## Adjusting for reporting delays

Estimating $R_t$ requires data on the daily number of new infections. Due to lags in the development of detectable viral loads, symptom onset, seeking care, and reporting, these numbers are not readily available. All observations reflect transmission events from some time in the past. In other words, if $d$ is the delay from infection to observation, then observations at time $t$ inform $R_{t−d}$, not $R_t$. [(Gostic et al., 2020)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409#sec007)

The **delay distribution** could be inferred jointly with the underlying times of infection or estimated as the sum of the **[incubation period](../learners/reference.md#incubation)** distribution and the distribution of delays from symptom onset to observation from line list data **([reporting delay](../learners/reference.md#reportingdelay))**.

For `{EpiNow2}`, we can specify these two complementary delay distributions in the `delays` argument.

## When to reuse? When to estimate?

In the early stage of an outbreak, we can rely on reusing parameters for known pathogens to unknown ones, like for the [Disease X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_X), a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease and potentially cause a  serious international epidemic ([WHO, 2018](https://www.who.int/activities/prioritizing-diseases-for-research-and-development-in-emergency-contexts)). 

But when data from **lines list paired with contact tracing** is available, we can estimate the key delay distributions that best fit our data. These will help us to inform, compare and update any previous estimate about questions like:

- How long should contacts be followed?
- What is the required duration of contact tracing?
- How long should cases be isolated to reduce transmission?

However, the methods to accurately estimate delays like the generation interval from contact tracing data involve adjusting for biases like **[censoring](../learners/reference.md#censoring)**, **[right truncation](../learners/reference.md#truncation)** and **[epidemic phase bias](../learners/reference.md#phasebias)**. [(Gostic et al., 2020)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409)

We can identify what entries in the `{epiparameter}` library assessed for these biases in their methodology with the `method_assess` nested entry:


```r
covid_serialint$method_assess
```

```{.output}
$censored
[1] TRUE

$right_truncated

### How to assess for pre-symptomatic infection?

The lengths of the Serial interval and Incubation period determine the type of disease transmission.

Estimating the proportion of pre-symptomatic infections, or the extent to which infectiousness precedes symptom onset will determine the effectiveness of contact tracing and the feasibility of controlling an outbreak ([Fraser et al., 2004](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0307506101) and [Hellewell et al., 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S2214-109X(20)30074-7/fulltext)).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `{epiparameter}` to access the systematic review catalogue of epidemiological delay distributions.
- Use `epidist_db()` to select single delay distributions.
- Use `list_distributions()` for an overview of multiple delay distributions.
- Use `discretise()` to convert continuous to discrete delay distributions.
- Use `{epiparameter}` probability functions for any delay distributions.
