## Who are these tutorials for? 

We thought about Lucia, Patricia, and Vania as learner personas in designing the contents of this training:

- [Lucia](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/personas/lucia-outbreaks.html), a Field Epidemiologist in a National Health Agency that uses R for data cleaning, plotting and automated reports.

- [Patricia](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/personas/patricia-discoverer.html), A PhD student learning to use R and analyse Outbreak data for her research project.

- [Vania](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/personas/vania-academica.html), a Professor who needs ready-to-use teaching material for her research and to pass on to students.
